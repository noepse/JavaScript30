    // Let's say we have an array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way
const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // poor man's deep clone of an object
    // hopefully spread operator for objects will come out soon
